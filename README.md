## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Keanan a software developer currently studing at HoGent in Belgium. My intrest within development lies in javascipt/ typescript, java, python and c#/.net. I'm currently working on some projects to hopefully add to my repository outside of school projects. An example of one such project would be the development of a webshop and inventory/ sales management application for Delaware.
